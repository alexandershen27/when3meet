## User stories

**Close submissions** (author: @alex)

As an event creator, I want to close submissions so that I can finalize a time for the meeting. Given I am logged in as the event creator, when I click "close poll", then attendees will no longer be able to modify their available times.

**Add event to calendar** (author: @alex)

As an event attendee, I want to download the event calendar so that I can add it to my personal calendar. Given I am on an event page after a time has been chosen, when I click the download event button, then a calendar event file will be downloaded with the finalized time.

**Anonymous participation** (author: @eduardo)

As an event attendee, I want to submit my availability without creating an account so that I can participate quickly. Given I am visiting a shared event link, when I enter my name and mark available times, then my availability is saved without requiring a signup.

**Time zone awareness** (author: @eduardo)

As an event creator, I want participants to see times in their local time zone so that they can respond accurately. Given the event has a set time zone, when an attendee opens the event page, then all times are displayed in their local time with a clear time zone label.
