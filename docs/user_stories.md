## User stories

**Close submissions** (author: @alex)

As an event creator, I want to close submissions so that I can finalize a time for the meeting. Given I am logged in as the event creator, when I click "close poll", then attendees will no longer be able to modify their available times.

**Add event to calendar** (author: @alex)

As an event attendee, I want to download the event calendar so that I can add it to my personal calendar. Given I am on an event page after a time has been chosen, when I click the download event button, then a calendar event file will be downloaded with the finalized time.
